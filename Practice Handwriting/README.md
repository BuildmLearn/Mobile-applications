# PracticeHandwriting

PracticeHandwriting, as the name suggests is an app that allows kids to practice their handwriting. Kids would be shown the boundary of a letter/word/number and they would have to trace it out and try and maximize their score by staying in the boundary. Some of its key features are

  - Haptic and visual feedback for wrong traces
  - Freehand (borderless tracing) to see how you do without boundaries
  - Time Trial Mode where you have to trace random letters/words in a given time limit

This app has been developed by [Vignesh Prasad](http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~vignesh.prasad).
