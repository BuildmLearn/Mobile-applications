Mobile-applications
===================

This repository contains source codes for the educational mobile applications listed below:

(i)'Label the diagram' mobile application:
With this mobile application, the aim is to help students to study ‘diagrams' from various subjects like Science, Physics and Biology. The idea behind this application is that it presents diagrams to the user on various subject topics. There would be a box containing set of words. The user needs to drag and drop the words to the right place in the diagram, so as to label part diagram. Score would be incremented when labelled correctly; also a short info regarding the label would be displayed. 

(ii)'Learn from Map' mobile application:
Basically, the idea behind this application is to have map features and introduce a gaming aspect for users to learn geography in a informal environment. The user would be able to play a quiz game, answers of which would be a location i.e. it can be a place, area, city, state or country. The user would be able to interact with the map in various ways like zoom-in, zoom-out, panning, tapping, etc. and navigate to any location on the map. In response to a question, the user can drop a pin at a location and answer.
Adding artificial intelligence: The application would provide options to the user about which region (countries, continents) he would like to play the quiz for. Automation of the questions for a particular region is also available. For example, if the user selects a country, the application could do computations, using some available semantics, to formulate questions for that country. The overall idea is to make it a fun experience for the user while making him learn geography informally.

(iii)Mobile application to measure sensor data:
In this mobile application, visualization of data from various mobile sensors is present. The application shows a list of all the sensors available in the device. Not only sensors, the list would also show various parameters that can be interpreted from these sensors. For example, elevation, noise and sound, magnetic field and seismic waves. When the user chooses a sensor / parameter from the available - the live data from the sensor (or the calculated parameter value) would be shown to the user. Various visualisations for representing this data would available. The simplest real time visualisation would be various types of 2-D graphs on which the value of sensor data / computed parameter has been plotted against time.

(iv)‘Practice handwriting’ mobile application:
This mobile application is helpful to children who are learning how to write, by allowing them to practice their handwriting skills. The application would present letters & words, and allow the kids to trace them. Voice/ Speech warnings would be given instantaneously when the trace is wrong. The kids would be able to restart the trace once they receive the warnings. As studies indicate, kids are more likely to spend more time practicing this on smartphone / tablets when compared to pen and paper. To start with, the application uses english literals (small, capitals, numerics) and words. This application framework is scalable to other languages.

(v) 'Tell the time' mobile application:
This mobile application teaches the kids about time. The application would contain different sets of activities to teach time telling and calendars. The application would be able to teach time principles in both 12 hr and 24 hr formats. As the application starts, some principles about how to tell the time would be presented. The user can navigate and see these again whenever he desires. Once the user is through the basic principles of 'time telling’ he can be riddled. An interactive clock would be displayed and the user would be asked to move hands of the clock to show the desired time. Text to speech is used along with this to make it more fun for the kids.
